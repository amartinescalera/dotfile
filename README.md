### ü§ñ Shell scripts

#### üçé [`install_macos_apps.sh`](install_macos_apps.sh)

This script will install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). It's a package manager for MacOS, used to install some tools like `htop`, `ffmpeg`, `git`, `php`‚Ä¶ you get the idea, Command Line Tools, programming languages, and so on.

Homebrew also includes [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/). It's a package manager useful to install fully functional OS X applications such as `google-chrome`, `spotify`, `slack`‚Ä¶

With these 2 command line tools, we'll be able to install and upgrade our apps without having to leave the terminal. This allow us to automate the whole setup process while starting clean on a new mac, and also to do not have to open all the different apps we've installed in order to update them.

You can [check out the `install_macos_apps.sh` script](install_macos_apps.sh) in order to see the detailed list of the apps it will install, and modify it based on your needs, and [the available packages in Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/) and [Homebrew Cask apps](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/tree/master/Casks).

#### üéõ [`adjust_macos_settings.sh`](adjust_macos_settings.sh)

This script will modify system preferences. We would recommend you to [take a look at the `adjust_macos_settings.sh` script](adjust_macos_settings.sh) in order to know the actual list of aspects it will modify. Here you have a brief list of them:

* Dock: Automatically hide the dock with a fewer delay and animation times
* Mission Control: Add Hot corners behaviour and reduce the animation time
* Safari & WebKit: Allow hitting the Backspace key to go to the previous page + show full URL + disable automatic spelling corrections‚Ä¶
* Others: Disable the sound effects on boot + always show scrollbars + disable automatic capitalization + Avoid creating .DS_Store files on network or USB volumes + Maximize windows with `Ctrl+alt+Cmd+f`‚Ä¶

#### üêç Another Scripts
* [`tube.sh`](tube.sh): Using youtube-dl extract the audio from youtbue videos
